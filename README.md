# Cloud Security Simulation (Research-Based)

This project simulates a research-aligned cloud cybersecurity prototype for SMEs, based on key concepts from a cloud security framework including IAM, SIEM, and EDR functionalities.

## Modules Simulated:
- IAM (Identity and Access Management): Tracks user logins and blocks brute-force attempts.
- EDR (Endpoint Detection & Response): Simulates malware detection and quarantine.
- SIEM (Security Information & Event Management): Simulates event detection and logging.

## Usage:
Run the Python script and simulate login attempts. System logs all activities including suspicious access and malware detection.

## Based on Research Insights:
This simulation is inspired by the research paper "Cloud-Based Cyber-Security Tool for Small and Medium Enterprises" which discusses a framework combining IAM, SIEM, DLP, and EDR services.

## Expandability:
- Connect to Flask UI for demo deployment
- Store logs in cloud (Firebase, MongoDB)
- Add DLP simulation

Educational use only.
